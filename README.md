# Packet-Simulator
Simulation of network packets being sent through a network of routers


Initially made a version in desmos, but was stopped by the limitations of Desmos
+ Nice visuals
+ Real time simulation
- Only one packet Max
DesmosVer1: (Many aspects are unutilized as they would have been useful for multiple packets)
