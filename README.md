# Packet-Simulator
Simulation of network packets being sent through a network of routers

V1.0.0:
Capable of simulating any number on packets being transfered through any number of routers
Simulates traffic in connections

Initially made a version in desmos, but was stopped by the limitations of Desmos: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zunmgmfeap
+ Nice visuals
+ Real time simulation
+ Only one packet Max
+ Only linear path

Created a simplified version without the redundant elements: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tki8rmdy3s
